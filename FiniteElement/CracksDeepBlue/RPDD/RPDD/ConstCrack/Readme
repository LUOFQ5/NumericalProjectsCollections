1. To run the code, Matlab BNT toolbox must be included in the path. This can be downloaded at https://code.google.com/p/bnt/

2. This is the code for constant crack growth model by using RPDD

3. Running file lists:

ConstCrack_RUN.m: Run file for the constant crack growth model

This run file inculdes following main function calls:

Constcrack_BLR.m constant crack growth model solved by Bayesian linear regression

ConstCrack_KF.m: Constant crack growth model solved by Kalman filter

ConstCrack_myDD.m: major running file for proposed RPDD algorithm

ConstCrack_Unif.m: Constant crack growth model using uniform interval for comparision purposes. 

ConstCrack_DDNeil.m: Constant crack growth model by using Neil's dynamic discretization with no merge operations

ConstCrack_myDDKL.m: Constant crack growth model with proposed RPDD algorithm but have KL error judgement. 


If you have any problem of running this code, please contact Jiandao Zhu (jiandaoz@gmail.com)
