1. To run the code, Matlab BNT toolbox must be included in the path. This can be downloaded at https://code.google.com/p/bnt/

2. The stochastic crack growth model

3. Running file lists:

StochasticCrack_RUN.m: Run file for the stochastic crack growth model

This run file inculdes following main function calls:


StochasticCrack_myDD.m: major running file for proposed RPDD algorithm

StochasticCrack_Unif_Log.m: stochastic crack growth model using uniform and logarithmic interval for comparision purposes. 

StochasticCrack_myDDKL.m: stochastic crack growth model with proposed RPDD algorithm but have KL error judgement. 

If you have any problem of running this code, please contact Jiandao Zhu (jiandaoz@gmail.com)
