This software is a research-code example of the interval uncertainty optmization method proposed in:
"Efficient optimization of reliability-constrained structural design problems including interval uncertainty" published in 
Computers and Structures by Liu, Jeong, and Collette.  It is provided here soley to help document the method developed
in this paper for other researchers developing code in this area.  It is not robust, optimized, or intended for use
as a practical implementation of the method.  

The majority of this source code covered by the MIT open-source license stated below.  The two exceptions are the:
1: PyRe - Python Reliability package in a sub-folder developed by Juergen Hackl and releadsed under the GPL license used here without modifiation. PyRe is located at: https://github.com/hackl/pyre
2: Latin Hypercube Code - latinhypercube.py - developed by Flavio Codeo Coelho and released under the GPL. http://model-builder.sourceforge.net/
