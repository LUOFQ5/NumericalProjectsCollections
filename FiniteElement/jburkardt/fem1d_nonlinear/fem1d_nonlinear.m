%% MAIN is the main program for FEM1D_NONLINEAR.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    FEM1D_NONLINLEAR solves a nonlinear one dimensional boundary value problem.
%
%    The differential equation has the form:
%
%      -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u + u * u' = f(x)
%
%    The finite-element method uses piecewise linear basis functions.
%
%    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
%    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
%
%    The values of U or U' at XL and XR are also specified.
%
%    Sample problem #1:
%
%    u(x) = x, 
%    p(x) = 1, 
%    q(x) = 0, 
%    f(x) = x, 
%    u(0) = 0, 
%    u'(1) = 1.
%
%    The code should solve this problem exactly.
%
%    Sample problem #2:
%
%    u(x)  = 2*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x))/pi, 
%    p(x)  = 1, 
%    q(x)  = 0,
%    f(x)  = -0.5*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x) + 2*sin(0.5*pi*x)*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x)/pi
%    u(0)  = 0, 
%    u'(1) = 1.

%    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
%    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.

%
%    real ARITE(NU).
%    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
%    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
%    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
%    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
%    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
%
%    real H(N), the length of the subintervals.  
%
%    integer IBC.
%    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.

%    associated with node I.
%    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
%    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
%    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
%    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
%    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
%    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
%    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
%    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U

%    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
%
%    integer NL.
%    The number of basis functions used in a single
%    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
%    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
%    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
%
%    integer NODE(NL,N).
%    For each subinterval I:
%    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and

%    The number of points at which the computed solution
%    should be printed out when compared to the exact solution.

%    This code uses NQUAD = 1.
%
%    integer N.
%    The number of subintervals into which the interval
%    [XL,XR] is broken.
%
%    integer NU.
%    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
%    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
%    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
%    of basis functions.
%
%    real RHS(NU), the right hand side of the linear equations
%    for the Picard or Newton iterations.
%
%    real U(NU).
%    U contains the value of the solution from the previous iteration,
%    and is used in ASSEMBLE to add correction terms to the
%    matrix and right hand side.
%
%    real UL.
%    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
%    to have at X = XL.

%    to have at X = XL.
%

%    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(1) is XL,
%    and XN(N+1) is XR.
%
%    real XNEWT.
%    A factor which is 0 for the first three iterations, and
%    1 thereafter.  It multiplies some terms in ASSEMBLE,
%    and thus is used to "weaken" the nonlinearity for
%    the first few steps.
%
%    real XQUAD(N)
%    XQUAD(I) is the location of the single quadrature point
%    in interval I.

%% ASSEMBLE_NEWTON assembles the Newton linear system.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The linear system being solved here is for the Newton correction
%    to an approximate solution of a nonlinear system.
%
%    Thus, we suppose that we have a nonlinear function F(X),
%    and an approximate solution X0.  If we can suppose there is an
%    exact solution X* that is "nearby", and in fact close enough
%    that Taylor's theorem gives us a useful estimate, then we
%    may write:
%
%      F(X*) = F(X0) + F'(X0) * ( X* - X0 ) + Order ( X* - X0 )^2 
%
%    and by rearranging, we get the Newton system (which is only
%    approximately correct):
%
%      F'(X0) * ( X* - X0 ) = - F(X0)
%
%    We solve this system and add the solution to X0 to get a
%    new approximate solution that, we hope, is much improved.

%  Discussion:
%
%    The equation we are trying to solve has the form:
%
%      -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u + u * u' = f(x)
%
%    For the Picard iteration, we need to modify the nonlinear term u * u'
%    so that it is linear in the unknown u, and any other factors of u are

%
%    where uold is the previous iterate.
%
%    Now we can formulate this system as a (linear) finite element problem
%

%  Input:
%
%    real ADIAG(NU), ALEFT(NU), ARITE(NU).
%    the diagonal, left and right entries of the equations.
%    Note that for the first equation, there is no ALEFT
%    coefficient, and for the last, there is no ARITE.
%    So there is no need to store a value in ALEFT(1), nor
%    in ARITE(NU).
%
%    real F(NU),  the right hand side of the linear
%    system to be solved.
%
%    integer NU.
%    NU is the number of equations to be solved.
%
%  Output:
%
%    real U(NU), the solution of the linear system.
%
