Phong Deformation demonstration using reference Houdini implementation


This software demonstration accompanies the SIGGRAPH 2020 paper:

Doug L. James. 2020. Phong Deformation: A better C0 interpolant for embedded
deformation. ACM Trans. Graph. 39, 4, Article 56 (July 2020), 9
pages. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3386569.3392371

and reproduces part of the "Cell" example (Figure 8).

   djames_phongdefoasset.hdanc
   djames_tetbarycoords.hdanc

in your Houdini installation's "otls" asset directory, e.g.,
/Users/djames/Library/Preferences/houdini/18.0/otls on mac osx.

Run the demonstration 

   phongDefo_CellDemo.hipnc

and see the instructions inside.
