This package contains source code for the C1 and C2 spline constructions for
polar configurations.
* C1 - Myles, Karciauskas, Peters - "Pairs of Bi-Cubic Surface
       Constructions Supporting Polar Connectivity.", CAGD 25(8),
       pp 621-630, 2008.
* C2 - Myles, Peters - "C2 Splines Covering Polar Configurations"
       CAD 43(11{), pp 1322-1329, 2011.

The spline constructions are in
* c1_polar_spline.m
* c2_polar_spline.m
The C2 construction is demonstrated on sample meshes in the test_* files.
