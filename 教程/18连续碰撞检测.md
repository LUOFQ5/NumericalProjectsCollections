The general goal in partitioning here is to select a partition of primitives that doesn’t have too much overlap of the bounding boxes of the two resulting primitive sets—if there is substantial overlap then it will more frequently be necessary to traverse both children subtrees when traversing the tree, requiring more computation than if it had been possible to more effectively prune away collections of primitives. This idea of finding effective primitive partitions will be made more rigorous shortly, in the discussion of the surface area heuristic.

Here, we choose just one of the three coordinate axes to use in partitioning the primitives. We select the axis associated with the largest extent when projecting the bounding box centroid for the current set of primitives. (An alternative would be to try all three axes and select the one that gave the best result, but in practice this approach works well.) This approach gives good partitions in many scenes; Figure [4.3](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Primitives_and_Intersection_Acceleration/Bounding_Volume_Hierarchies#fig:bvh-centroid-axis) illustrates the strategy.
